<p><font size = "3" face="verdana">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
<p> Tags such as img  and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
</p>
<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

<div>
<p><font size = "3" face="verdana">HTML is a set of codes that a website author inserts into a plain text file to format the content. The author inserts HTML tags, or commands, before and after words or phrases to indicate their format and location on the page. HTML tags are also used to add tables, lists, images, music, and other elements to a webpage.</p>
<p>
Web documents contain three main sections: the head, title, and body. The head includes the webpage’s identifying information, including the website’s title and important keywords. The viewer sees the site’s title, but any other information is hidden. The site’s title appears in the browser’s tab and is what appears when a user tries to bookmark a site.</p>
<p> The body section is the main portion of the webpage visible to the viewer, including the text and graphics. HTML tags are also used in two additional ways that are not visible to the viewer: as meta tags and comments. Meta tags indicate keywords associated with the webpage to search engines. Comments are intended as explanation or additional information for other writers or readers of HTML code.</p>
<p>
Website authors do not need to write HTML code themselves to create a webpage. Using an HTML editor, site authors design web documents while the program writes the HTML code. A WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) HTML editor is a software program with an interface similar to a word processing program that site authors use to write and format text and position graphics as they will appear on the webpage.</p>
